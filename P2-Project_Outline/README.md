## Submission Instructions

### Overview
(Ammaarah Khan)
- Our project will be a list tracker that will allow users to list and categorize their needs, wants and problems.
- Users will be able to create an account, log in, view their profile, create, edit, and remove list items. Users will be able to select giver or receiver badge to place on their profile. Changeable at anytime. Users can be search by receiver badge, and search list items by tags associated with list item and location.
- This idea was born out of the desire to reorient how we talk about our needs, wants, and problems. In our individualistic world it is an opportunity to engage that we can in fact help each other but we must be able to ask for it.
